\arguments{
\item{parent_hospitalised}{Logical scalar. Whether the parent (HCW infector) is hospitalised.}

\item{parent_time_to_hospitalisation}{Numeric scalar \eqn{\ge 0} or \code{NA}. If hospitalised,
the time from infection to hospital admission; must be non-negative. If not hospitalised,
must be \code{NA}.}

\item{parent_time_to_outcome}{Numeric scalar \eqn{\ge 0}. Time from infection to outcome
(recovery/death); used to truncate the generation-time distribution.}

\item{mn_offspring_hcw}{Positive numeric. Mean of the Negative Binomial offspring distribution
for HCW parents (\code{rnbinom(mu = ..., size = ...)}).}

\item{overdisp_offspring_hcw}{Positive numeric. Negative Binomial \code{size} (overdispersion)
for HCW parents.}

\item{Tg_shape_hcw}{Positive numeric. Shape of the Gamma generation-time distribution
for HCW parents (before truncation).}

\item{Tg_rate_hcw}{Positive numeric. Rate of the Gamma generation-time distribution
for HCW parents (before truncation). Mean GT is \code{Tg_shape_hcw / Tg_rate_hcw}.}

\item{prob_hospital_cond_hcw_preAdm}{Numeric in \code{[0,1]}. Probability that a \strong{pre-admission}
candidate infection occurs in the \strong{hospital} setting (while the HCW is working); the
complementary probability assigns the event to the community.}

\item{ppe_efficacy_hcw}{Numeric in \code{[0,1]}. Efficacy of PPE/IPC at reducing \strong{pre-admission
hospital} transmission; pre-admission hospital keep-probability equals
\code{1 - ppe_efficacy_hcw}.}

\item{hospital_quarantine_efficacy}{Numeric in \code{[0,1]}. Efficacy of \strong{post-admission
hospital} quarantine at reducing transmission; post-admission hospital keep-probability equals
\code{1 - hospital_quarantine_efficacy}.}

\item{prob_hcw_cond_hcw_comm}{Numeric in \code{[0,1]}. Probability that a \strong{community}-located
offspring generated by an HCW parent is an HCW.}

\item{prob_hcw_cond_hcw_hospital}{Numeric in \code{[0,1]}. Probability that a \strong{hospital}-located
offspring generated by an HCW parent is an HCW.}

\description{
Simulates secondary infections (offspring) generated by a \strong{healthcare-worker} parent.
The number of candidate offspring is drawn from a Negative Binomial distribution.
Candidate infection times are drawn from a \strong{truncated Gamma} generation-time distribution
on \eqn{[0, t_\mathrm{outcome}]}. For HCW parents, \strong{pre-admission} candidate infections
may occur in the \strong{hospital} (while working) or in the \strong{community}: each pre-admission
event is assigned to the hospital with probability \code{prob_hospital_cond_hcw_preAdm}
and to the community otherwise. Candidate events occurring at or after the parent’s
hospitalisation time are always labelled \code{"hospital"}. Hospital-setting events are then
thinned to reflect protection before admission (PPE/IPC) and quarantine after admission:
pre-admission hospital keeps with probability \eqn{1 - \mathrm{ppe\_efficacy\_hcw}}; post-admission
hospital keeps with probability \eqn{1 - \mathrm{hospital\_quarantine\_efficacy}}. Finally, each
offspring is assigned a class (\code{"HCW"} or \code{"genPop"}) using setting-specific probabilities.
