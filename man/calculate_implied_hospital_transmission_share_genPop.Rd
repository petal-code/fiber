\usage{
calculate_implied_hospital_transmission_share_genPop(
  p_hosp,
  shape_h,
  rate_h,
  shape_out,
  rate_out,
  gt_shape,
  gt_rate,
  kappa = 1,
  n = 20000,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_hosp}{Numeric in \code{[0,1]}. Probability a parent is hospitalised.}

\item{shape_h, rate_h}{Positive numerics. Gamma(shape = \code{shape_h}, rate = \code{rate_h})
for the time to hospitalisation (when hospitalised).}

\item{shape_out, rate_out}{Positive numerics. Gamma(shape = \code{shape_out}, rate = \code{rate_out})
for the time to outcome (death/recovery).}

\item{gt_shape, gt_rate}{Positive numerics. Gamma parameters for the generation time.}

\item{kappa}{Numeric scalar or vector in \code{[0,1]}. Hospital keep-probability
used in thinning (community keep is fixed at 1).}

\item{n}{Integer \eqn{\ge} 1. Number of Monte Carlo parent draws.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer for reproducibility passed to \code{set.seed()}.}
}
\description{
Computes the \strong{expected fraction} of transmissions that occur in hospital
(among retained/kept events) when community keep-probability is fixed at 1
and hospital keep-probability is \code{kappa}. Times to hospitalisation and
outcome are assumed \strong{independent} and Gamma-distributed; the generation
time (GT) is also Gamma-distributed. The expectation is evaluated by Monte
Carlo over the parent population.
}
\details{
For a given parent with GT mass fractions \eqn{q_c} (pre-admission) and
\eqn{q_h} (post-admission), the hospital share among kept events is
\deqn{f(\kappa) = \frac{\kappa q_h}{q_c + \kappa q_h}.}
This function estimates \eqn{\Pi(\kappa) = E[f(\kappa)]} across parents.
